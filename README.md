## Scenario

As a developer I would like to create my own collection of NFTs, I have heard about the Infura NFT API/SDK so I want to use it to achieve my goal.

For this demonstration, I will use goerli testnet to do the following things.

- Deploy my ERC721 smart contract and mint 2 NFTs.

- Transfer one of the NFTs to a specific address.

- Use the infura NFT API to display the list of NFTs by collection.

- Use the Infura NFT API to display list of NFTs by collection and wallet.

- Use the Infura NFT API to display the metadata of my Collection.
